Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 60044 to get the flag? You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.

ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 60044 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}
